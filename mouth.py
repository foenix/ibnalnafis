The mouth of ibnalnais is a file of all such things which may have once been
considered a "view" or "controller".
I like mouths, though. Mouths are truly where most of our cogntion finds it's
end-point (and if your mind is in the gutter, that's alright, most of the stuff
pushed out of the mind is crap anyways).

If you haven't guessed it yet, ibnalnafis is a direct referece to:
Ala al-Din Abu al-Hassan Ali ibn Abi-Hazm al-Qurashi al-Dimashqi
علاء الدين أبو الحسن عليّ بن أبي حزم القرشي الدمشقي 

Or, as his mates prefered to call him: ابن النفيس
(IPA: ĭbn ul-næfis)
Ibn al-Nafis: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Nafis

This fine gentleman studied the vascular system of the human anatomy. He
brought together many advanced ideas in his day to do so; and it showed in his
demeanor. He studed many things: linguistics, futurology,
primordial-psychology, logic, literature, sociology, geology, medicine — why
not do the same in his honour with a well-wrought CRM. Something from the
ground-up and able to be applied to a number of things.

Anyways, this app is basically a document broadcaster which implements rss,
ranking, and relational magix to relay the words of whomever around. 

The primary goal of this project is to bring together current state-of-the-art
web-programming. A secondary priority is mega-scalability. This site is
currently designed with a fair amount of use in mind (and not just http).
